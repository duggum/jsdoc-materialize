### Why?

I am a bit of a geek who is new to MCPE and modding, or as my 8-year-old daughter refers to me: an old guy who uses his kid as an excuse to play Minecraft. Regardless, I am interested in making mods for MCPE, and I would like to get my daughter into coding her own mods as well. Using ModPE is the obvious introductory route, but I have found information on how to use the API to be quite fragmented and kind of all over the place.

There are lots of example mods, simple code samples, and incomplete API documentations out there, to be sure. Unfortunately, I found myself spending a lot of time just searching for the right bit of info or code example that would help me fully understand what `function foo()` does, or what the hell the parameter `par3double` *really* means. Anyway, I figured that the best way to learn the API was to document the damn thing, so here you go.

The ultimate goal is to have every ModPE function fully documented, to include a full description of the function and its parameters, as well as meaningful code examples to demonstrate it's use. Additionally, I would like to have a library of tutorials where modding pros dig deep into some of the more advanced uses for the ModPE library.

I am finding the task to be a bit daunting on my own, so feel free to help out.

Cheers!
